Life
====

A game of life with SDL


How to
-----------
~~~bash
$ make
$ ./life maps/double_breeder.png
~~~

Maps are loaded from images (where 1 pixel corresponds to 1 cell), you can edit your map with gimp !

There are also various options like screen size, fullscreen mode, ascii mode, rules changing.
But I don't remember the program syntax. Look at the source for now ... I will do better one day !

Key Control
-----------
> R -> run

> P -> pause

> S -> stop

> A -> zoom+

> Z -> zoom-

> arrows -> move camera

> space -> reset the camera position

> C -> faster

> V -> slower
